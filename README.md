codes for artificial intelligence 1 activities

see **ia1-descricao.pdf** [ptbr] 

attention: ugly codes, not refactored nor efficient.

what needs to be done

## q1
- [ ] modularize code
- [ ] fix presentation stage
    - [ ] dfs
    - [ ] bfs
    - [ ] idfs
- [ ] fix dfs (idk why it is not working properly)
- [ ] add solutions' depth in every algorithm 
    - [ ] dfs, bfs
    - [ ] idfs
- [ ] add solutions' path 
    - [ ] dfs, bfs
    - [ ] idfs
- [ ] add unit tests

## q2
- [ ] fix forward chaining (no question needed, just get results in facts base)
- [ ] fix back and forward to consider differents antecedents producing one
consequent
